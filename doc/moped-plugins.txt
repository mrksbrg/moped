Additions:
What about plugin in Eclipse? It is mentioned in the "Plugin Manual"
before building a plugin, you need to build api.
build with Maven (mvn clean install)




For clearing the simulator, do rm apps/* and rm db/*
And same in can-utils/java on the TCU.
You may need to use sudo.

TODO: describe what the plugin code should look like, and how it is
compiled.
But see PlugInManual.docx.

pom.xml
plugin configuration file (XML)
ports

See moped-ports.txt

The simulator only supports a subset of the sensors and actuators.
See moped-simulator.txt


Existing plugins (and the ports they use):

For VCU:

    AdcPub (0,7)
	publishes the battery value
    AP (3,4,5,6)
	"auto path" - accelerates and turns here and there
	when the actual wheel speed is near zero, it's defined as an
	obstacle and the car reverses
    BWPub (0,6)
    CL ()
    Circle (3,4)
	runs at varying speeds in a small circle
    Comm1 (SCU)
    Comm2 (VCU)
	Comm1 and Comm2 run on separate ECU's and communicate
    DistPub (0,13)
	publishes distance
    FWPub (0,5)
    LEDLighter (9)
	lights and extinguishes all three LEDs, periodically
    Platoon (3,15)
    PluginCreationTest ()
	writes only something on stdout
    PluginCreationTest2 (4)
    PluginCreationTest3 (4)
    PosPub (0,8)
    SemiAutomaticReverseParking (0,4,5,9)

For SCU:
    IMUPub (0,14)
    UltraSonicReader (13,VCU)
	reads distance and sends it to a port where AutoBrake will read it


In addition, AutoBrake (3,9,SCU) exists, but is not compilable. This
may be easily fixed. Also BurningWheels (which may use an older way of
communicating).



A plugin P needs a 'main' method, a constructor P() and a constructor
P(String [] args).

The simulator calls it with the 'main' method. On autosar, the one-argument
constructor is used.

The zero-argument constructor seems not to be called, but if it isn't there,
the simulator will fail to load the plugin.




Compiling and uploading a plugin, for example the existing plugin LEDLighter,
with version 1.0:

Compiling:

The plugin is compiled with "mvn clean install" and uploaded from the
"target" directory.
