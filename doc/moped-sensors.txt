* speed

This is computed from the frequency with which a light is turned into
pulses by reflectors distributed evenly on the inside of a wheel. Thus,
only the absolute value of the speed is reported.

The measurements are made by a separate process, which writes a value into
a memory cell which the sensor port then reads. So reading fast gives you
the same value several times in sequence. This is maybe the case with all
sensors.


Testing the speed sensor without actually using the motor is easy: rotate
one of the back wheels by hand (the mechanics make the other wheel rotate
in the other direction).

* steering


* distance

Minimum distance is 3 cm. 37xx is maximum, but it seems to mean that it
doesn't detect the echo. 637 is the highest value I have received which
represents a real distance.

It seems that with very large distances, there may be no answer at all
from the port. I don't know why that is.

The area reached by the sensor has an angle of about 15 degrees in
both directions from the forward direction. I don't know if the shape
is conical, or if it is wider in the left-right direction that up-down.
It points slightly upwards so it will miss the floor.

It seems that it only detects the echo if its angle to the reflecting surface is
45-90 degrees.

GPS, I think, but it's not used

six values

The unit contains a compass as well.
