Occasionally, the receiving of an installation package on an ECU from
the TCU fails, either because it never got everything (there is a
printout "ready?" followed by two numbers), or because the reading of
frames (the smallest units of data that are sent) got out of synch (there
is a printout "consec: not same sequence number").

Performing the same operation again will probably be successful. If the
ECU crashed, it has to be restarted first.

When powered by the aggregate, trying to use the servo/motor can make
the TCU (and maybe everything) immediately restart. When by battery,
it works well.  I think this is due to a fall in voltage, not to a
loose connection.

The ultrasonic sensor is handled in such a way that it must be
connected in order for the SCU to run at all: if even one pin is
disconnected, the SCU pauses or crashes.

The maximum size of a plugin is 4096 bytes. This should be increased.
