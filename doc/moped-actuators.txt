* steering

-100 to 100

0 should be straight ahead, but the mechanics may be such that setting
0 after -100 makes the wheels point straight ahead, while doing so after
100 makes them stay noticeably to the right.


* speed

The value can be set to between -100 and 100. Negative numbers mean
reversing, but setting first a positive speed and then a negative one
will probably lead to 256+speed being used. At least 0 should be
set explicitly. More things may be needed, but I don't understand this
yet. Possibly the steering should be set each time, too. Suitable pauses
are important, and it takes a while for the thing to start (at which time
the hardware beeps to indicate this).

Currently, the actual reverse speed is lower than the forward speed,
for the same speed setting. This can apparently be configured
somewhere in the motor unit.

Look at AP.java, Circle.java.



* LED

The LEDs are numbered 1 to 3. To light one, set it to 0. To extinguish,
set it to 1.

LED 1 = red
LED 2 = left yellow (?)
LED 3 = right yellow (?)


Send a string like this to the port: "3|1".
