How SD cards behave.

A card may be mountable and have these files with correct content, but
still refuse to boot.

Conversely, a card may be unrecognized by a computer, but fully working
as TCU.

SD cards may get worn and stop functioning. It could be that they still
work in a computer or SD card reader, but not in the Raspberry.
Once, one of the small plastic ridges between the contacts broke. I could
fix that by simply removing most of the ridge.

Sometimes an ECU fails to start because the SD card is somewhat loose.
One theory is that this is especially likely to happen with the micro SD
cards.

If the problem is the contacts inside the raspi board, it may get better
if a few strips of paper are put under the SD card.
